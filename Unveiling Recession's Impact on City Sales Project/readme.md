# Unveiling Recession's Impact on City Sales

## Objective

This project aims to analyze the impact of recessions on car sales across different cities in the United States. By focusing on data from recessionary periods (identified by the "Recession" column with a value of 1), I will create a visual representation that reveals which cities faced the most significant sales declines during economic downturns.

## Methodology 
### 1. Data Preparation:

I'll filter the original dataset to include only records from recessionary periods.
The data contains information on car sales, consumer confidence, advertising expenditures, unemployment rates, and other economic indicators. I'll focus on "City" and "Automobile_Sales" columns for this visualization.

### 2. Visualization: Choropleth Map

Employing Folium, I'll create a choropleth map of the United States.

Each state will be colored based on the average sales decline experienced by its cities during recessions. Cities with the most significant sales drops will be represented by darker shades, while those with less decline will be lighter.

I'll leverage the "City" information to associate sales data with corresponding geographical locations.

### 3. Interpretation:

By analyzing the map, I can identify patterns in city-level sales performance during economic recessions.

Cities shaded darker on the map suggest a more substantial dip in sales compared to lighter-colored areas.

## Implications and Conclusion

The choropleth map will provide a clear visual representation of how recessions affect car sales across various US cities. This visualization can be used by:

Car manufacturers and dealerships: To understand which markets are most vulnerable during economic downturns and potentially adjust marketing strategies accordingly.

Economists and policymakers: To gain insights into the geographical distribution of recessionary impacts, informing policy decisions aimed at mitigating economic hardship.
