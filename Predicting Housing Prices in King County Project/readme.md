# Predicting Housing Prices in King County

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating house prices in King County, USA. By analyzing various features of houses, the model aims to provide valuable insights for real estate professionals and potential homebuyers.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Data Collection: Gather relevant house data from King County, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, and property type.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

### 2. Model Selection and Training:

Ridge Regression: Choose Ridge regression as the modeling technique due to its ability to handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting.

Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets, then train the Ridge regression model on the training data using the selected features.

### 3. Model Evaluation:

Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared to assess how well it explains the variance in the target variable (house price).

## Insights and Conclusion

The developed model can be used to:

Estimate House Prices: Provide accurate predictions of house prices based on various features, aiding potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

Identify Important Factors: Determine the most influential features in predicting house prices, offering insights into market trends and preferences.

Support Real Estate Professionals: Assist agents and appraisers in valuations and negotiations.

The Ridge regression model, trained on the selected features and tuned with a regularization parameter of 0.1, achieved an R-squared score of [insert R-squared value] on the test data. This indicates that the model explains a significant portion of the variation in house prices, demonstrating its predictive power.
